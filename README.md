his project is an **Arduino-powered radar system** using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect objects and visualize their positions in real-time. The system scans the environment by rotating the sensor with a **servo motor**, measuring distances, and displaying the results on an Processing-based GUI.
